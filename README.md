## Project Overview:
This project focuses on implementing a spam detection system using machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP). The system is designed to automatically identify and filter out unwanted or malicious messages from digital communications, such as emails or text messages (SMS).

Key Features:
Text Classification: Utilizes supervised learning algorithms to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.
Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features from text data, including word frequencies and structural characteristics.
Model Evaluation: Assesses performance using metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy to ensure effective spam detection.
Deployment: Includes instructions for deploying the spam detection system, integrating it into various digital platforms.
Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Flask (for web application framework)
GitLab (for version control and CI/CD pipelines)
Usage:
Installation:

Clone the repository.
Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
Training the Model:

Use provided scripts or integrate custom data for training.
Adjust model parameters as necessary for optimal performance.
Deployment:

Integrate the trained model into your application or system.
Ensure continuous updates and monitoring to adapt to evolving spam tactics.
